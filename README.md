# Atom-C
These are just my life's projects as I am going down the path of learning and discovering C. 
Over this repository you will find several assignment codes as done by me, some test files that I use for testing new concepts before implementing to my code, a few header files 
created by me, some that will include things I have learnt and tried and some will include things I have collected from all over the internet and made into one(like the color.h) file. 
<BR><U><B>The codes could be found in the Codes branch in this repository.</B></U>
<BR>Hope you will like the codes, for any suggestion I am always open to that. Feel free to contact me on my Discord @FireDrop6000 #9410.
